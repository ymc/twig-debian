Debian packaging of Twig
========================

This git repository contains the Debian packaging of Twig. It is not meant
to be used for developing Twig itself. If you want to contribute to Twig
please visit: https://github.com/fabpot/Twig

Reporting bugs
--------------
Once Twig has been accepted in Debian, bugs regarding Twig in Debian or
issues with the packaging itself can be reported using Debian's bugtracker.
Till then fell free to use Github's [issues](https://github.com/ymc/twig-debian/issues) feature.

About Twig
----------
Twig is a modern template engine for PHP
* Fast: Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code.
   The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.
* Secure: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code.
   This allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where
   users may modify the template design.
* Flexible: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser.
   This allows the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and
   create its own DSL.
