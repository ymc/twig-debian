Description: Flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP
 Twig is a modern template engine for PHP
 Fast: Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code.
  The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.
 Secure: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code.
  This allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where
  users may modify the template design.
 Flexible: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser.
  This allows the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and
  create its own DSL.

Description: Twig php5 extension
 This php extension written in C enhances the performance of the Twig runtime
 engine. It does so by providing an optimized version of the method
 Twig_Template::getAttribute().
 .
 Note that this extension does not replace the PHP code of the Twig template
 engine, since it is meant to only accelerate the template compilation done
 by Twig on runtime.
 .
 For more details about the Twig template engine see the twig package
 description.
